# The `src/app` Directory

## Overview

```
src/
  |- app/
  |  |- app.constants.json
  |  |- app.controller.js
  |  |- app.module.js
  |  |- app.run.js
  |  |- app.spec.js
```

The `src/app` directory contains all code specific to this application. Apart
from `app.*.js` and its accompanying tests (discussed below), this directory is
filled with subdirectories corresponding to high-level sections of the
application, often corresponding to top-level routes. Each directory can have as
many subdirectories as it needs, and the build system will understand what to
do. For example, a top-level route might be `productManagement`, which would be a directory
within the `src/app` directory that conceptually corresponds to the top-level
route `/products`, though this is in no way enforced. `productManagement` may then have
subdirectories for `inventory`, `pricing`, `product`, etc. The `product` submodule may
then define a route of `/products/:id`, ad infinitum.


## `app.constants.json`

This small, yet powerful file host a JSON object of key value pairs to be used
throughout the application. From this object, the build process will generate
a file containing AngularJS constants [here](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/blob/master/gulp.config.js#L86), which can then be injected into your
various AngularJS controllers, factories, providers, etc. Think of it as a base
configuration or settings file for your application.

Constant | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
`appname` | string | A short name for your application. This will be used in the `<title>` as well as displayed in the top left navigation of the application.
`scope` | string | A space delimited string of [OrderCloud roles](https://documentation.ordercloud.io/guides/authentication/security-profiles#Roles) that will be requested during authentication.
`clientid` | string | An [OrderCloud ClientID](https://documentation.ordercloud.io/guides/getting-started/using-the-dashboard#Applications) for the seller application that will be used for authentication.
`environment` | string | A string declaring the OrderCloud environment the application will point to. Currently, only `production` is available; however, when a large release consisting of breaking changes is scheduled, a `staging` environment will be provided.
`defaultstate` | string | The default ui-router state within the application that users will be directed to should they attempt to access a state that does not exist.
`html5mode` | bool | True/false whether you want HTML5 Mode enable within the application.
`bootswatchtheme` | string | The Bootswatch theme that is automatically applied to the application during the build process. A list of available themes can be found [here](https://bootswatch.com/). A value of `null` will apply the default angular-seller theme.


### Process Environment Variable Overrides

The constants provided above can be overwritten within your hosting providers application settings. For example, within Heroku, you can override these constants using their [Config Variables](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars#setting-up-config-vars-for-a-deployed-application). This is accomplished in the [`gulp.config.js`](https://github.com/ordercloud-api/angular-seller/blob/master/gulp.config.js#L116-L121) file, which can be customized to include additional application constants.


### Connecting to Your Seller Organization

Linking your front-end application to an OrderCloud seller organization can be accomplished using the `scope` and `clientid` constants described above.


## `app.controller.js`

This is the application's main controller. `AppCtrl` is a good place for logic
not specific to the template or route, such as menu logic or page title wiring. This controller also allows for numerous Angular services such as `$state` and `$ocMedia` and service methods such as `ocIsTouchDevice` and `stateLoading` to be globally available throughout the application's various templates. `AppCtrl` is not declared in a state provider like the application's component controllers. Instead, it is declared directly in `index.html` with `ng-controller="AppCtrl as application"`.

```js
angular.module('orderCloud')
    .controller('AppCtrl', AppController)
;

function AppController($state, $ocMedia, LoginService, appname, ocStateLoading, ocIsTouchDevice, ocRoles) {
    var vm = this;
    vm.name = appname;
    vm.$state = $state;
    vm.$ocMedia = $ocMedia;
    vm.isTouchDevice = ocIsTouchDevice;
    vm.stateLoading = ocStateLoading.Watch;
    vm.logout = LoginService.Logout;
    vm.userIsAuthorized = ocRoles.UserIsAuthorized;
}
```

## `app.module.js`

This is our main app file. It kickstarts the whole process by
requiring all the modules that we need.

By default, the OrderCloud AngularJS Seed includes a few useful modules written
by the AngularJS and Angular-UI teams. We also include the `orderCloud.sdk` module for connecting to the OrderCloud API. Lastly, some helpful third party modules are included as well, such as `toastr` and `angular-busy`.

All components within the application are tied directly to the `orderCloud` module, so they do not need to be included here.

```js
angular.module('orderCloud', [
        'ngSanitize',
        'ngAnimate',
        'ngMessages',
        'ngTouch',
        'ui.tree',
        'ui.router',
        'ui.select',
        'ui.bootstrap',
        'ui.select',
        'orderCloud.sdk',
        'LocalForageModule',
        'toastr',
        'angular-busy',
        'jcs-autoValidate',
        'treeControl',
        'hl.sticky',
        'angularPayments'
    ]
);
```

## `app.run.js`

Use the main applications run method to execute any code after services
have been instantiated. By default, we initialize `ocStateLoading`, validation error messages (using `angular-auto-validate`), and validation styling.

```js
angular.module('orderCloud')
    .run(AppRun)
;

function AppRun(ocStateLoading, defaultErrorMessageResolver, ocErrorMessages, validator) {
    ocStateLoading.Init();

    defaultErrorMessageResolver.getErrorMessages().then(function (errorMessages) {
        angular.extend(errorMessages, ocErrorMessages);
    });

    validator.setValidElementStyling(false);
}
```

## `app.spec.js`

One of the design philosophies of `angular-seller` is that tests should exist
alongside the code they test and that the build system should be smart enough to
know the difference and react accordingly. As such, the unit test for `app.*.js`
is `app.spec.js`.
